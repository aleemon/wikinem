# Overview of the NEM

The National Electricity Market is the electricity market (and name of the connected grid) on the populous east coast of Australia. The NEM is one of the longest grids in world, stretching approximately 5,000 km from Port Lincoln in South Australia to Port Douglas in Queensland. Undersea cables connect Tasmania to the NEM.

The NEM began in 1998, with the initial interconnection between Victoria, New South Wales South Australia. Queensland was connected in 2000 and Tasmania in 2005.

The NEM operates at a frequency of 50 Hz and pricing is done on a regional basis. High voltage interconnectors join each region.

The NEM is an energy-only design - generators are paid the marginal price on a 5-minute basis.
