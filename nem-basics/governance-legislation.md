# Governance and Legislation


## Overview

The Australian Energy Market Operator is responsible for managing and operating the NEM (as well as the WEM and gas markets) on a day-to-day basis. AEMO is a not-for-profit corporate entity – its full operating costs are recovered via fees charged to all market participants (including those passed on through retailers to end users). AEMO’s remit is to be an impartial operator of the electricity system – achieving the objectives of reliability and security as per the National Electricity Objectives (NEO ), without favouring any specific participant or technology.

The Australian Energy Market Commission is a government body, reporting to the Energy Ministers’ Meeting (previously the Council of Australian Governments, the panel representing the state governments). The AEMC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the National Electricity Rules (NER) and defining the National Electricity Objective. All changes to the Rules must be processed by the AEMC. Note that the AEMC cannot propose rule changes itself, even though it often produces reports suggesting changes to the rules (which may then be utilised by other organisations seeking change).

The Australian Energy Regulator is the government body responsible for policing the energy markets. The AER is related to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The AER defines some guidelines outlining responsible behaviour in the market and enforces the Rules with fines or administrative action.

Two overarching goals of the NEO are reliability and security.
•	The reliability of a power system is the ability to provide enough electricity to meet consumer demands. The reliability standard requires that there is sufficient generation and transmission interconnection such that 99.998% of annual demand for electricity is expected to be supplied. This can also be represented as the inverse – the maximum Unserved Energy (USE) is the amount of electricity demanded by customers at risk of not being supplied.
•	The security of a power system is the ability to maintain the technical parameters of the system within acceptable guidelines – i.e. the voltage and frequency of the system are within the technical envelope and the system is able to withstand faults within a reasonable level.
