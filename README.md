# WikiNEM

WikiNEM is an open source documentation project for the National Electricity Market.

It's aims are threefold:

1. To provide a consolidated place for documentation and information about the NEM, for both beginners and veterans alike
2. Attempt to document more completely the missing gaps in the AEMO documentation
3. Provide a place for collaboration and knowledge sharing amongst industry veterans with specific detailed speciality areas

_More to come soon, including information on how you can contribute_

To Do:
- Start porting over documentation and organising it
- Dig up all the resource links and set them up
- Consider storing Unsplash images locally?
- Figure out how to size the images in the page headers
- Investogate custom YAML headers on the pages
- Figure out if it's possible to remove the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page (might be a Gitbook thing)
- Set collaboration information and guideline
- Find good resources on git, markdown editing and collaboration bets practices
- Add licence information
